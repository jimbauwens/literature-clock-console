# literature-clock-console

Node.js application that prints literature quotes containing the current time to the console.

Based on the work from [literature-clock](https://github.com/JohannesNE/literature-clock) and the original work by [Jaap Meijers](http://www.eerlijkemedia.nl/) ([E-reader clock](https://www.instructables.com/id/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/)).


## Screenshot
Piping the output into cowsay gives a nice greeter. Current versions of cowsay don't properly support ANSI escape characters, so a patch was required to fix it. I contacted the maintainer and hopefully the patch will be integrated soon.
